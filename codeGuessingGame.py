# first import the random module 

# The random module in Python is a 
# built-in module that provides a 
# random number generator. It can be 
# used to generate random numbers, shuffle lists,
# and perform other random operations. The
# random module is a powerful tool that can 
# be used for a variety of tasks, such as:

# Generating random numbers for
#  games and simulations
# Shuffling lists of data
# Creating random passwords
# Generating random strings
# Performing other random operations
# The random module is easy to use. 
# To generate a random number, you 
# can use the random() function. For 
# example, the following code will 
# generate a random number between 0 and 10:

# number = random.randint(0, 10)
# Use code with caution. Learn more
# The random module also provides a
#  variety of other functions for
#  generating random numbers, such as:

# randrange(): Generate a random 
# number within a specified range

# choice(): Choose a random element from a list

# shuffle(): Shuffle a list in place

# sample(): Return a random sample of 
# elements from a list

# The random module is a powerful
#  tool that can be used for a
#  variety of tasks. If you are
#  looking for a way to generate 
# random numbers in Python, the 
# random module is a great option.

import random


# initialize an array to house the code to guess
NUM_CODE = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];


# define constant variable which contains starting 
# number of attempts
ATTEMPTS = 10;

print(ATTEMPTS)
